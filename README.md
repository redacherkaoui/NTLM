# NTLM Relay Attack Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

When conducting a security check in Windows authentication mechanisms, we simulated man-in-the-middle attacks in our lab environment. We successfully captured and relayed NTLM authentication handshakes by positioning an intercepting proxy between the client and target server. The attack achieved unauthorized access to protected web resources, demonstrating a critical security vulnerability in Windows authentication protocols.

## Attack Methodology

We established a controlled environment with a web server configured for Windows Authentication using NTLM protocol. By manipulating DNS resolution, we forced the client to bypass Kerberos authentication and fall back to NTLM, creating an opportunity for credential interception and relay.

## Technical Implementation

The attack leveraged standard NTLM relay techniques to act as a transparent proxy between the client and target server. When the victim client attempted to authenticate through the malicious proxy, the relay tool successfully captured the complete NTLM authentication exchange and forwarded it to the target system.

**Attack Flow:**
```
Client Browser → [NTLM Authentication] → Relay Proxy → [Forwarded Credentials] → Target Web Server → [Successful Response] → Unauthorized Access
```

## Proof of Exploitation

The attack successfully demonstrated:
- **Complete NTLM handshake interception** and relay capability
- **Successful credential forwarding** to target web server
- **Unauthorized access achievement** with successful authentication responses
- **Protected resource retrieval** including full content access through relayed authentication

## Key Findings

1. **NTLM Protocol Vulnerability**: The relay attack succeeded because NTLM lacks mutual authentication, allowing attackers to forward client credentials to unauthorized targets without detection.

2. **Cross-Protocol Exploitation**: HTTP-to-HTTP credential relay demonstrates how authentication from one service can be abused to access completely different systems.

3. **Network Position Advantage**: An attacker positioned between client and server can intercept and replay authentication tokens without requiring password cracking or credential theft.

4. **Authentication Bypass**: The attack circumvents traditional access controls by leveraging legitimate user credentials in unauthorized contexts.

## Real-World Attack Scenarios

### Enterprise Network Compromise
**Initial Access Vector**: Attackers commonly gain network position through:

- **Real-time exploitation**: Immediate access without lengthy offline attacks
- **Credential reuse**: Same attack can target multiple services using relayed authentication

## Security Implications

This demonstrates how NTLM relay attacks can enable unauthorized access to network resources using legitimate user credentials, highlighting the critical need for proper authentication protocol hardening in Windows environments. The attack represents a fundamental weakness in legacy Windows authentication that affects:

## Risk Assessment

**Severity**: High
**Business Impact**: Authentication bypass vulnerability enabling unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data across multiple attack vectors

## Recommendations

1. **Disable NTLM authentication** where possible, enforce Kerberos with proper SPN configuration
2. **Implement SMB signing** and **Extended Protection for Authentication** on all services
3. **Deploy network segmentation** to limit credential relay attack surface
4. **Enable advanced threat detection** for anomalous authentication patterns
5. **Migrate to modern authentication** protocols (SAML, OAuth 2.0, certificate-based authentication)

## Conclusion

The successful NTLM relay attack demonstrates a critical vulnerability in Windows authentication mechanisms that can lead to complete network compromise. Organizations must prioritize authentication protocol modernization and implement comprehensive hardening measures to protect against credential relay attacks in enterprise environments.
